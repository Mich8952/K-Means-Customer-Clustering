Reccs as follows:
Cluster 1:
Convienence. The product should be advertised as a convinent way to grow greens in which you will no longer have to go to the grocery store to aquire them. 

Cluster 2:
Health: The product advetisement should focus on the product and its relation to good health. I.e. not having pesticides and being 100% organic. Individuals who buy this unit will grow food that they know 100% of what was put into it. There are no surprises

Cluster 3:
Financial: Advertise the product as being financially beneficial in the long run. These individualls are slighly lower income so "sav[ing] money" should be the major focus.

Cluster 4:
Gadget: Advertise as some sort of cool device that would impress your friends. There seems to be less people in this cluster (from the sample) so allocate less time to developing this. Demonstrate the cool led lighting and mechanical motor whirls. Ensure that this advertisement uses dark colors and spotlight-like lighting.

Cluster 5:
Time efficiency: Advertise from a time perspective. Showcase busy individuals who keep forgetting certain aspects such as "buying groceries" and have children yelling "Im hungry". This will demonstrate to viewers that the device will help with efficiency, especially to those who have busy schedules.

With this, you can focus certain targeted ads towards users of specified ages, incomes, and residency types such that it will help to increase engagement and revenues.
